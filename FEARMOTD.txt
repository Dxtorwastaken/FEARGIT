Welcome to the remake of FearVR! My name is Dxtor, and I have using unity for 2 and half years now.
My main project I worked on was Monke Tag, and I have recently bought FearVR. I have alot of skill, 
and I want to add a twist to the horror fan game scene. FearVR is all about your scariest phobias, and we want to manifest that into a GTAG fan game! 
This game offers exciting levels, and simple but complex puzzles.  We offer 10 levels per chapter, and yes you heard me, CHAPTER! Since there are a BUNCH of phobias, 
we expect to make a lot of chapters, filled with new and fun levels to explore and beat. Around the various maps, you will find lore. The more lore you find, 
the closer you are to connecting the dots. I have alot of stuff planned for this game, and I hope to appeal to your taste. 
With all that being said, byeeeeeeeeee!
